# Video Tag Retrieval Process Overview

## Extracting Name Parameter:
- The code extracts the `name` parameter from the Astro params.
- If the `name` parameter is not present, it redirects to the "/tags" page.

## Fetching Video Tag Data:
- The code fetches data for a specific video tag using the extracted `name`.
- The API endpoint is constructed with the sanitized `name` (spaces replaced with hyphens).
- The data is fetched with a cache duration of 1 minute.

## Handling Not Found Case:
- If the fetched data contains a message indicating "not found," it redirects to the "/tags" page.

## Fetching Video Data for Each Video in the Tag:
- For each video ID in the fetched video tag data, asynchronous requests are made to fetch detailed video information.
- Each video data is fetched with a cache duration of 1 minute.

## Resolving Promises and Gathering Video Data:
- The promises for fetching video data are resolved concurrently using `Promise.all`.
- The final result is an array (`vids`) containing detailed information for each video in the video tag.
